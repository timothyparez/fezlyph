# Fezlyph - A simple FEZ glyph translator

I started playing [Fez](https://www.fezgame.com/) again and needed a way to quickly translate the secret glyph language.  
Most websites I found were either full of spam or not mobile friendly, so I quickly made this.

It's extremely basic, but it gets the job done.
